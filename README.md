## What is Pesa Ya Siri?

Pesa Ya Siri means *Secret Money* in Swahili.

It is a ZCash-powered peer-to-peer payment wallet that runs entirely over WhatsApp. No app download. No bank account. No KYC. No technical knowledge required.

A user sends a WhatsApp message:
SEND 0712345678 5

And five ZEC is transferred privately to another phone number within seconds.

---

## Why it exists

Tanzania has 60 million people. Mobile money is everywhere — but every transaction is tracked, logged, and visible to the government and operators.

ZCash provides full financial privacy. Pesa Ya Siri delivers it through the one platform Tanzanians already use every day: WhatsApp.

## How it works

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | User sends CREATE on WhatsApp |
| 2 | System generates a shielded ZCash z-address linked to their phone number |
| 3 | User buys a physical recharge card from a local vendor |
| 4 | User sends REDEEM [code] — ZEC is credited instantly |
| 5 | User sends SEND [phone] [amount] to transfer ZEC to anyone |
| 6 | Recipient gets a WhatsApp notification. Transaction is shielded on-chain. |
